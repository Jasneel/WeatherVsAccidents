This graph shows the total number of accidents that happened in USA from the year 2017 to 2020 in various states of the country.

We were able to present this information through an amazing graph that is shaped like a map of the United States of America and is based on latitudes and longitudes of various locations to indicate which regions of the nation had more or less drunk drivers who were involved in fatal accidents.

# Number of Accidents in each month of 2020

When we dug a bit deeper into the year 2020, we discovered that the number of accidents ranged from 12500 to 20000, with the month of October having the most accidents for this particular year, with a total of: 20242. Which was once again unexpected given that it had been one of the peak months for COVID pandemic.

# Number of Accidents due to the weather conditions

If we look at the year 2020, we can see that most accidents (148720) occurred when the sky was clear, followed by cloudy weather with 30513 accidents, freezing rain or drizzle and rain with 16349 and 14759 accidents, respectively. This suggests that weather did not seem to have a significant impact on accidents.

# Accidents on different days of the Week

We were able to determine which days of the week had the most and fewest accidents after conducting some analysis. Again, it was quite unexpected to learn that Saturdays, which are weekends, are when the majority of accidents occur. This disproved the theory that accidents would increase on weekdays as a result of everyone rushing to work and making wrong judgments while driving.

# Numbers of Accidents relationship with differents times in a Day

We carried out an in-depth analysis to identify the pattern that the number of accidents was rising as the day went on. According to our observations, accidents tended to happen more often between 6 and 7 p.m. and less frequently between 4 and 5 a.m.
